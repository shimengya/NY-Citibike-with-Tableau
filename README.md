# Overview & purpose of the statistical analysis:
To convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal, this project provides more detailed analysis regarding trips in different time, by gender and also give investor a clear map to show the number of trips.

For this analysis, I mainly get the help of Tableau. In the meanwhile, pandas also helps to analysis the raw dataset.

There is a description of the results for each visualization (7 pt)


# Summary:

There is a high-level summary of the results and two additional visualizations are suggested for future analysis (5 pt)

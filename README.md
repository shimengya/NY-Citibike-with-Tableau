# Overview & purpose of the statistical analysis:
To convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal, this project provides more detailed analysis regarding trips in different time, by different gender. Per the analysis, we will find the both popular start stations and end stations via a clear map showing the number of trips.

For this analysis, I mainly get the help of Tableau. In the meanwhile, pandas also helps to analysis the raw dataset.
